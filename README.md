## Introduction
Face recognition is a biometric technique which involves determining if the image of the face of any given person matches any of the face images stored in a database. This problem is hard to solve automatically due to the changes that various factors, such as facial expression, aging and even lighting, can cause on the image. Among the different biometric techniques facial recognition may not be the most reliable but it has several advantages over the others. It is widely used in various areas such as security and access control, forensic medicine, police controls and in attendance management system.
## Purpose 
The various techniques for marking attendance are: 
1) Signature based System
2) Fingerprint based System 
3) Iris Recognition 
4) RFID based System 
5) Face Recognition 
Amongst the above techniques, Face Recognition is natural, easy to use and does not require aid from the test subject. It is a series of several related problems which are solved step by step: 
1. To capture a picture and discern all the faces in it. 
2. Concentrate on one face at a time and understand that even if a face is turned in a strange direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.
3. Determine various unique features of the face that can help in distinguishing it from the face of any other person. These characteristics could be the size eyes, nose, length of face, skin colour, etc.
4. Compare these distinctive features of that face to all the faces of people we already know to find out the personâ€™s name
